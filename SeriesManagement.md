# Using Series Management

ArcKeep's Series Management module helps you organize your writing projects by series, books, chapters, and scenes.

## What it does
- Allows you to create and manage multiple series
- Organize books within each series
- Structure chapters and scenes for detailed planning

## Step-by-step usage
1. Go to the Series Management section from the dashboard.
2. Click "Add Series" to start a new series.
3. Within a series, add books, then chapters, and scenes as needed.
4. Use drag-and-drop to reorder items.

## Tips and Tricks
- Use color coding to differentiate series or books
- Add notes to chapters and scenes for quick reference
- Link scenes to characters and locations for better organization

## Limitations or Known Issues
- Bulk editing is limited; changes must be made individually
- Scene linking to timeline is not automatic
