ArcKeep is a web application designed for authors to
  manage book series. It helps them track continuity,
  including characters, locations, scenes, timelines, and
  relationships across their books.

### Key Features

   * Hierarchical Content Structure: Organizes your work
     from a high-level series down to individual scenes
     (Series â†’ Books â†’ Chapters â†’ Scenes).
   * Character Tracking: Manages character details,
     including their status, relationships with other
     characters, and appearances throughout the timeline.        
   * Location Management: Organizes locations hierarchically     
     (e.g., from a city down to a specific room).
   * Timeline Events: Allows for the creation of custom
     events with validation to ensure continuity.
   * Relationship Mapping: Defines and tracks bi-directional     
     relationships between characters, including the type and    
      status of their connection.

### Who is ArcKeep for?
ArcKeep is for authors, especially those who write book
  series and need a tool to manage complex narratives and
  maintain continuity across multiple chapters and books.
